      The functional organization of human high-level visual cortex, such as the
      face- and place-selective regions, is strikingly consistent across
      individuals. An unanswered question in neuroscience concerns which
      dimensions of visual information constrain the development and topography
      of this shared brain organization. To answer this question, we used
      functional magnetic resonance imaging to scan a unique group of adults
      who, as children, had extensive visual experience with Pokémon. These
      animallike, pixelated characters are dissimilar from other ecological
      categories, such as faces and places, along critical dimensions (foveal
      bias, rectilinearity, size, animacy). We show not only that adults who
      have Pokémon experience demonstrate distinct distributed cortical
      responses to Pokémon, but also that the experienced retinal eccentricity
      during childhood can predict the locus of Pokémon responses in adulthood.
      These data demonstrate that inherent functional representations in the
      visual cortex—retinal eccentricity—combined with consistent viewing
      behaviour of particular stimuli during childhood result in a shared
      functional topography in adulthood.

      Humans possess the remarkable ability to rapidly recognize a wide array of
      visual stimuli. This ability is thought to occur as a result of cortical
      computations in the ventral visual stream1 : a processing hierarchy that
      extends from the primary visual cortex to the ventral temporal cortex
      (VTC). Previous research has shown that VTC responses are key for visual
      recognition because (1) distributed VTC responses contain information
      about objects2–4 and categories5 , and (2) responses in category-selective
      regions in the VTC, such as the face-, body-, word- and place-selective
      regions6–12, are linked to the perception of these categories13–15.
      Distributed VTC response patterns to different visual categories are
      distinct from one another and are arranged with remarkable spatial
      consistency along the cortical sheet across individuals16–23. For example,
      peaks in distributed VTC response patterns to faces are consistently found
      on the lateral fusiform gyrus (FG). Although several theories have been
      suggested to explain the consistent spatial topography of the VTC24–26,
      developmental studies suggest that experience may be key for the normal
      development of the VTC and recognition abilities. For example, behavioural
      studies suggest that the typical development of recognition abilities is
      reliant on viewing experience during childhood27–32. However, the nature
      of childhood experience that leads to consistent spatial functional
      topography of the VTC—whether it is the way stimuli such as faces or
      places are viewed, or the image-level statistics of the stimuli
      themselves—remains unknown. Several theories have proposed attributes that
      may underlie the functional topography of human high-level visual cortex.
      These include: (1) the eccentricity bias of retinal images associated with
      the typical viewing of specific categories19,24, for example, face
      discrimination is thought to require high visual acuity supported by
      foveal vision, but peripheral vision is believed to be more important for
      processing places, as in the real world they occupy the entire the visual
      field; (2) the average rectilinearity of stimuli from particular
      categories25,33, for example, faces are curvilinear, but man-made places
      tend to be rectilinear; (3) the perceived animacy of stimuli5,34–37, for
      example, faces are perceived to be animate whereas places are not; and (4)
      the real-world size of stimuli38, for example, faces are physically
      smaller than places and buildings. Each of these theories proposes an
      underlying principle to describe the coarse functional topography of the
      VTC relative to its cortical macroanatomy. That is, inherent in all these
      theories is the idea that a physical or perceived dimension of a stimulus
      maps onto a physical dimension along the cortical surface. For example, in
      the human VTC, small, curvy, animate and foveal stimuli elicit stronger
      responses lateral to the mid-fusiform sulcus (MFS), whereas large, linear,
      inanimate and peripherally extending stimuli elicit stronger responses in
      the cortex medial to the MFS. <br />
      However, which of these dimensions drives the development of the
      functional organization of the VTC is unknown. Research on cortical
      plasticity in animals has made two key discoveries related to this
      question. First, eccentricity representations in the early and
      intermediate visual cortex are probably established in infancy39,40, as
      they may be constrained by both wiring41 and neural activity that starts
      in utero42. For example, research on ferret and mouse development suggests
      that retinal waves during gestation and before eye-opening are sufficient
      to establish eccentricity representations in the visual cortex40. An
      eccentricity proto-architecture is also detectable early in infant macaque
      development39. Second, visual development has a critical period during
      which the brain is particularly malleable and sensitive to visual
      experience32,43–48. For example, previous research suggests that new
      category representations in high-level visual cortex emerge with
      experience only in juvenile macaques, but not if the same experience
      happens to adult macaques43. Furthermore, visual deprivation of a category
      (for example, faces) in infancy results in a lack of development of a
      cortical representation for that category32. Together, these findings
      support the following predictions regarding human development: first, if
      eccentricity representations in high-level visual cortex are present early
      in development, then eccentricity stands to be a strong developmental
      constraint for the later emergence of object representations; second,
      testing theories of VTC development requires the measurement of the
      effects of childhood experience on the formation of new brain
      representations.

        information across the VTC.
      </b>
      Experienced participants were adults (n=11, mean age 24.3±2.8 yr, 3
      female) initially chosen through self-reporting, who began playing Pokémon
      between the ages of 5 and 8 yr. Experienced participants were included in
      the study if they continued to play the game throughout childhood and
      revisited the game as adults. Novice participants were chosen as similarly
      aged and educated adults who never played Pokémon (n=11, mean age 29.5±5.4
      yr, 7 female). We validated their self-reported experience with Pokémon
      with data from a behavioural experiment, in which participants viewed 40
      Pokémon images from the original Nintendo game and identified each image
      by name (from 5 choices). Experienced participants (n=11) significantly
      outperformed novices (n=9) in their naming ability of Pokémon (Student’s
      t-test, t(18)=18.2, P < 0.01 Cohen’s d=8.18; Fig. 1a). Despite not being
      able to name Pokémon, novices are capable of visually distinguishing and
      individuating Pokémon characters (Supplementary Fig. 1). <br />
      All participants underwent fMRI while viewing faces, bodies, cartoons,
      pseudowords, Pokémon, animals, cars and corridors (Fig. 1b). Cartoons and
      animals were chosen to create a strict comparison to the Pokémon stimuli
      and the other categories were included as they have well-established and
      reproducible spatial topography across the VTC49. Stimuli were randomly
      presented at a rate of 2Hz in 4 s blocks, each containing 8 images from a
      category. Participants performed an oddball detection task to ensure
      continuous attention throughout the scan. Participants completed six runs
      with different stimuli from these categories. We first examined whether
      childhood experience affects the representation of category information in
      the VTC, which was anatomically defined in each participant’s native brain
      (see the MVPA section in the Methods). Therefore, at the individual level,
      we measured the representational similarity among distributed VTC
      responses to the eight categories across runs. Each cell in the
      representational similarity matrix (RSM) is the voxelwise correlation
      between the distributed VTC responses to different images of the same
      category (diagonal) or different categories (off-diagonal) across split
      halves of the data. Then, we averaged the RSMs across the participants of
      each group and compared across groups to examine the representational
      structure of distributed VTC responses in experienced and novice
      participants. Averaging across participants of each group allowed us to
      visualize consistency within a given group. We then used decoding
      approaches to quantify these representational structures in individual
      participants, described below.

      We hypothesized that the representation similarity of distributed VTC
      responses will have one of four outcomes. The first is the null
      hypothesis: Pokémon will not elicit a consistent response pattern in the
      VTC in any group and will have near-zero correlation with other items of
      this and other categories. Second, the animate hypothesis: Pokémon, which
      have faces, limbs and resemble animals to some extent, will have positive
      correlations with animate categories, such as faces, bodies and animals.
      Third, the expertise hypothesis: if Pokémon are processed as a category of
      expertise, then distributed responses to Pokémon will be most correlated
      with distributed responses to faces, as the expertise hypothesis predicts
      that expert stimuli are processed in face-selective regions50,51. Fourth,
      the distinctiveness hypothesis: as Pokémon constitute a category of their
      own, they will elicit a unique response pattern. Thus, correlations among
      distributed responses to different Pokémon will be positive and
      substantially higher than the correlation between Pokémon and items from
      other categories. <br />Experienced participants differ markedly from
      novices in their distributed VTC response patterns to Pokémon (see the RSM
      in Fig. 2a). Unlike novices, who demonstrate little to no reproducible
      pattern for Pokémon in the VTC, consistent with the null hypothesis (mean
      Pearson correlation±s.d., r=0.1±0.06, n=11), experienced participants
      demonstrate a significantly more reproducible response pattern for Pokémon
      (r=0.27±0.11; significant betweengroup difference: t(20)=4, P< 0.001,
      d=1.8). Furthermore, distributed responses to Pokémon were distinct from
      those of other categories in experienced participants. We quantify this
      effect by calculating the mean dissimilarity (D=1−r) of distributed
      responses to Pokémon from other categories. Distributed responses to
      Pokémon are significantly more different from distributed responses to the
      other categories in experienced participants than controls (t(20)=4.4, P<
      0.001, d=1.8). Interestingly, in experienced participants, Pokémon
      response patterns are significantly dissimilar (all t(20)< 4.2, all P<
      0.001, all d>0.89) from those of faces (D±s.d.=0.97±0.08), bodies
      (1.1±0.08) and animals (0.9±0.07) despite Pokémon having faces, bodies and
      animal-like features themselves. In contrast, when excluding Pokémon,
      groups do not have a significantly different D between distributed
      responses to other pairs of categories (t(20)=0.52, P=0.6, d=0.19).

        cortical responses. </b
      >Results of the previous MVPA suggest that intense childhood experience
      with a novel visual category results in a reproducible distributed
      response across the human VTC that is distinct from other categories. An
      open question is whether Pokémon generate distributed response patterns
      with similar topographies across experienced participants. Therefore, we
      generated statistical parametric maps that contrast the response to each
      category versus all others (units: T values) and compared across groups.
      In typical adults, stimulus dimensions such as eccentricity19,55,
      animacy37,56, size26 and curvilinearity25 are mapped to a physical,
      lateral−medial axis across the VTC49.<br />
      As the responses to faces on the lateral VTC and places on the medial VTC
      generate the most differentiated topographies, we analysed the properties
      of Pokémon stimuli for these attributes relative to faces and places.
      Thus, we used these metrics to generate predictions for the emergent
      topography of a Pokémon representation in experienced participants. As
      expected, in both groups, unthresholded contrast maps demonstrating
      preferences for faces and places showed the typical topography in relation
      to major anatomical landmarks. That is, despite both anatomical and
      functional variability between participants, preference for faces was
      found in the lateral FG and preference for places in the collateral sulcus
      (CoS), as illustrated in Fig. 3. However, striking differences can be
      observed when examining VTC responses to Pokémon. In novices, Pokémon do
      not elicit preferential responses in the VTC, as with faces or corridors
      (Fig. 3a). In contrast, an example experienced participant demonstrated a
      robust preference for Pokémon in the lateral FG and occipitotemporal
      sulcus (OTS; Fig. 3b). This pattern was readily observable in all the
      other experienced participants (Supplementary Fig. 3). Given that these
      data suggest childhood experience with Pokémon results in a spatially
      consistent topography for Pokémon across individuals, we next asked: what
      attributes of Pokémon drive this topography? The stimuli of faces,
      corridors and Pokémon used in the localizer experiments were submitted to
      a variety of analyses with the goal of ordering these categories linearly
      along different feature spaces (see the Image statistics analyses section
      in the Methods). Stimuli were analysed for physical attributes of foveal
      bias, that is, the retinal size of images when fixated on across a range
      of typical viewing distances, and rectilinearity, using the Rectilinearity
      Toolbox25, which evaluates the presence of linear and curved features at a
      range of spatial scales. Stimuli were also rated for attributes of size
      and animacy, by independent raters, described below.

    <p>
      <b
        >Location of novel cortical responses in experienced participants
        supports eccentricity bias theory. </b
      >To test these predictions, we produced contrast maps for Pokémon versus
      all other stimuli in each participant. Using cortex-based alignment (CBA),
      we transformed each participant’s map to the FreeSurfer57 average cortical
      space, where we generated a group average Pokémon-contrast map. For
      visualization, we projected the map onto an individual experienced
      participant’s cortical surface. These results revealed four main findings.
      First, in experienced, but not novice participants, we observed that
      preference for Pokémon reliably localized in the OTS. As illustrated in
      the average experienced participants’ Pokémon contrast map (Fig. 5a),
      higher responses to Pokémon versus other stimuli were observed in the OTS
      and demonstrated two peaks on the posterior and middle portions of the
      sulcus. Second, we compared Pokémon activations to those of faces by
      delineating the peaks of face selectivity in the average contrast maps for
      faces in each group (Fig. 5a, white outlines). This comparison reveals
      that for experienced participants, Pokémon-preferring voxels partially
      overlapped face-selective voxels on the lateral FG and extended laterally
      to the OTS, but never extended medially to the CoS, where place-selective
      activations occur (Fig. 3). <br />
      Third, we compared the volume of category selectivity for Pokémon in each
      group. Pokémon-selective voxels were any voxels within the VTC that were
      above the threshold (T>3) for the contrast of Pokémon versus all other
      stimuli. Pokémon-selective voxels were observed in the lateral FG and OTS
      of all 11 individual experienced participants. In contrast, although some
      scattered selectivity could be observed for Pokémon in four novice
      participants, it was not anatomically consistent. Thus, it did not yield
      any discernible selectivity for Pokémon in the average novice selectivity
      map (Fig. 5a). An ANOVA run with the factors group and hemisphere on the
      volume of Pokémon-selectivity in the VTC revealed a main effect of group
      (F(1,1)=32.75, P< 0.001, η2=0.45), but no effects of hemisphere, nor any
      interaction (Fs(1,1)< 0.67, Ps>0.41, η2 s< 0.016). The median volume in
      experienced participants was sixfold larger than novices (Fig. 5a), with
      most (7 of 11) novice participants having close to zero voxels selective
      for Pokémon. This difference in volume between groups was not driven by
      gender differences (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Fourth, we compared the
      lateral−medial location of Pokémon selectivity relative to face and place
      selectivity to directly assess theoretical predictions. Therefore, we
      partitioned the VTC in each experienced participant into four anatomical
      bins from lateral (OTS) to medial (CoS); see the inset in Fig. 5b. Within
      each bin we extracted the mean T value for the contrast of either Pokémon,
      faces or corridors. Curves fitted to average T values across bins
      demonstrate that (1) peaks in these curves are the most lateral for
      Pokémon, intermediately lateral for faces and medial for corridors (Fig.
      5b) and (2) Pokémon-selectivity peaks are located significantly more
      laterally in the VTC than those of faces (t(20)=2.88, P=0.009, d=1.23).
      Together, this pattern of results is consistent with only the predictions
      of the eccentricity bias theory for the development of VTC topography
      (Fig. 4a).

      <b>How does experience affect the amplitude of responses to Pokémon?. </b
      >To further understand how novel childhood experience has impacted
      cortical representations in the VTC, we asked two questions. First, are
      the emergent responses to Pokémon in experienced participants specific to
      the Pokémon characters that participants have learned to individuate, or
      will similar patterns emerge for any Pokémon-related stimulus from the
      game? Second, how does visual experience change the responsiveness of the
      OTS to visual stimuli? To address the first question, a subset of
      experienced participants (n=5) participated in an additional fMRI
      experiment in which they viewed other images from the Pokémon game (see
      the Pokémon scenes and pixelated faces fMRI control experiment section in
      the Methods). In this experiment, participants completed a blocked
      experiment with two categories of images: images of places (for example,
      navigable locations) from the Pokémon game as well as downsampled face
      stimuli (to resemble 8bit game imagery). Images were presented in 4 s
      blocks at a rate of 2Hz while participants performed an oddball task.
      Results show that places from the Pokémon game drive responses in the CoS,
      not the OTS or the lateral FG. In other words, they produce the typical
      pattern of place-selective activations (Fig. 7). In contrast,
      Pokémon-selective voxels in each participant (Fig. 7, black contours) have
      minimal to no selectivity for places from the Pokémon game, further
      demonstrating the specificity of Pokémon-selective voxels to Pokémon
      characters. To answer the second question, namely, how experience shapes
      responses in the OTS, we quantified the response amplitude of
      Pokémon-selective voxels in both experienced and novice participants. To
      ensure that the region of interest (ROI) was defined independently from
      the individual’s data, we employed a leave-one-out approach60 in which we
      produced a group-defined Pokémon ROI from ten experienced participants by
      transforming ROIs from individuals to the FreeSurfer cortical average
      using CBA and then using CBA to project the group ROI to the left-out
      individual’s brain and examining its responses. This procedure was
      repeated for each experienced participant. For novice participants, we
      transformed the group ROI produced from all the experienced participants
      into each individual novice’s brain. To ensure that we did not extract a
      signal from cortex that was already selective for another category, we
      removed any voxels that were selective for other categories from the group
      Pokémon ROI for each participant. From this independently defined Pokémon
      ROI, we extracted the percent signal change from the eight-category fMRI
      experiment.

        a, Average contrast maps for Pokémon in novice and experienced
        participants. For each participant, T-value maps were produced for the
        contrast of Pokémon versus all other stimuli. These maps were aligned to
        the FreeSurfer average brain using cortex-based alignment (CBA). On this
        common brain surface we generated a group-average contrast map by
        averaging maps across all novice participants and all experienced
        participants. Group-average maps are shown on an inflated right
        hemisphere of one of our participants, zoomed in on the VTC. White
        outlines show groupaverage face-preferring voxels (average T> 1) from
        each respective group. Grey arrows show two peaks in the
        Pokémon-selectivity maps of experienced participants; the same arrows
        are shown next to the novice map for comparison. Inset: box plots show
        the mean (white line), 25% and 75% quartiles (boxes) and range (black
        dotted line) of the selectivity volume in novices and experienced
        participants. b, Curves fitted to the mean selectivity for Pokémon,
        faces or corridors, averaged in one of four anatomically defined regions
        extending from the lateral to medial VTC (illustrated in the inset for
        an example participant). Each line represents a participant and the
        triangles show the peak selectivity values. The peaks for the
        Pokémon-selectivity curves are significantly more lateral than the peaks
        for face selectivity. The most lateral ROI is the OTS extending from the
        inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) to the medial aspect of the OTS. The
        lateral FG (latFG) ROI includes the lateral FG and ends medially at the
        MFS; the medial FG (medFG) bin extends from the MFS to the lateral edge
        of the CoS; the CoS bin includes the CoS up to the lateral edge of the
        parahippocampal gyrus.

    <h3>Discussion</h3>
    <p>
      By examining cortical representations in adults who have had visual
      experience with a specific, artificial visual category since childhood, we
      found that participants who have extensive experience with Pokémon
      characters, beginning as early as 5 yr old, demonstrate distinct response
      patterns in high-level visual cortex that are consistent across
      participants. Category-selective responses to Pokémon in all experienced
      participants occupied the posterior and middle extent of the OTS, largely
      lateral to face-selective cortex, and responded selectively to learned
      Pokémon characters rather than general imagery from the Pokémon game. Note
      that we do not assert that our results should be interpreted as a new
      Pokémon functional module in the OTS of experienced participants on par
      with the face-selective cortex7 . Instead, our data underscore that
      prolonged experience starting in childhood can lead to the emergence of a
      new representation in the VTC for a novel category with a surprisingly
      consistent functional topography across individuals. We demonstrated that
      this topography is consistent with the predictions of the eccentricity
      bias theory for two reasons: the small stimuli that required foveal vision
      during learning biased the emergent representations towards the lateral
      VTC; and Pokémon-selective voxels in experienced participants show a
      foveal bias. Together, our data show that shared, patterned visual
      experience during childhood, combined with the inherent retinotopic
      representation of the visual system, results in the shared brain
      organization observed in the adult high-level visual cortex.<br />
      The nature of Pokémon as a stimulus category is an interesting one,
      because it could be seen as similar to other ecological stimuli such as
      faces or words: the game entails repeated, prolonged and rewarded
      experience individuating visually similar, but semantically distinct
      exemplars. This is similar to other stimulus categories for which there is
      ecological pressure, or interest, to individuate among a visually
      homogeneous category such as faces, birds or cars. Our data suggest that
      individuals who have had life-long experience individuating Pokémon
      characters develop a novel representation for this learned category,
      demonstrating the plasticity of high-level visual cortex outside of the
      face-selective regions. This was supported by robust decoding results and
      a consistent spatial topography of selectivity for Pokémon in experienced
      but not novice participants. Our findings suggest that early childhood
      visual experience shapes the functional architecture of high-level visual
      cortex, resulting in a unique representation whose spatial topography is
      predictable. One should exercise caution when comparing the current
      findings with the effects of visual expertise that was acquired in
      adulthood62–64, as the current study focuses on participants whose visual
      experience began at a young age. There are several differences that
      distinguish our current results from such previous research on expertise.
      First, childhood experience led to the development of a new representation
      for Pokémon that was anatomically consistent across participants and was
      coupled with increased responses and selectivity for Pokémon in the OTS.
      As the same piece of cortex did not show selectivity in novices, this
      suggests that extensive experience individuating a novel stimulus
      beginning in childhood is necessary and sufficient for the development of
      a new representation in the VTC. Although previous investigations of
      category training in adults also demonstrated increases in voxel
      selectivity for the learned category different from our data, these
      activations were not anatomically consistent across individuals and
      occurred either in the object-selective cortex or outside the visual
      cortex entirely (in the prefrontal cortex). Second, Pokémon elicited
      numerically, but not significantly, higher responses in the face-selective
      cortex of our experienced participants than in our novices. Although these
      data are consistent with previous reports of increased responses in
      face-selective areas on the FG to stimuli of expertise gained in
      adulthood, it is unclear from our data whether these increased responses
      are due to experience or due to the fact that Pokémon have faces
      (Supplementary Fig. 9). Third, previous research has shown that learning
      contextual and semantic features of novel objects in adulthood (for
      example, this object is found in gardens) can influence VTC
      representations66. Thus, part of the emergent representation for Pokémon
      in experienced participants may have stemmed not only from visual
      features, but also contextual and semantic information learned about
      Pokémon. In other words, the representation of Pokémon may include
      additional semantic and contextual information, such as its habitat and
      characteristics, that can be investigated in future studies. Lastly,
      developmental work in humans with parametrically morphed stimuli has shown
      that improved perceptual discrimination among face identities in adulthood
      is linked with increased neural sensitivity (lesser adaptation) to face
      identity in the face-selective cortex from childhood to adulthood67.
      Higher neural sensitivity is thought to be due to narrower neural tuning.
      Future research can test whether childhood experience with Pokémon also
      affects neural tuning by measuring adaptation to parametrically morphed
      Pokémon in experienced versus novice participants.<br />
      Our findings also have interesting parallels with research on the
      development of reading abilities in children. First, visual experience
      with Pokémon began between the ages of 5 and 8 yr old, similar to the ages
      during which reading ability rapidly improves69. Second, it is interesting
      that, like looking at Pokémon, reading words requires foveation and words
      typically subtend small retinal images. Third, similar to our findings,
      research on the development of reading has shown that the word-selective
      cortex emerges during childhood in the lateral OTS and distributed
      representations in the OTS and the lateral FG become more informative from
      childhood to adulthood with increasing reading experience52,70. Thus, our
      data together with the research on the development of reading, suggest
      that the critical window for sculpting unique response patterns in the
      human VTC extends to at least school age.<br />
      Our results converge with previous research in macaques that offers
      compelling evidence for three important developmental aspects of
      high-level visual cortex. First, its organization is sensitive to the
      timing of visual experience43. In macaques, learning new visual categories
      in juveniles but not adults resulted in new category-selective regions for
      the trained stimuli. This suggests that there may be a critical
      developmental period for cortical plasticity in high-level visual cortex.
      Second, in macaques, early visual experience led to the formation of
      category selectivity in consistent anatomical locations33 and deprivation
      of visual experience with stimuli such as faces results in no
      face-selective cortex32. Third, eccentricity may be a strong prior that
      constrains development in high-level visual cortex. For example, in the
      macaque visual cortex, a protoeccentricity map is evident early in infant
      development39,40. However, our data also highlight key developmental
      differences across species. First, the critical window of cortical
      plasticity in high-level visual cortex may be more extended in humans than
      macaques. In humans, extensive discrimination training in adults results
      in changes in amplitudes62,71 and distributed representations63 in
      high-level visual cortex, but in adult macaques, responses43 and
      distributed representations72 do not change, even as the monkeys become
      behaviourally proficient at the task (but see ref. 73, which shows
      increases in the number of inferotemporal neurons responsive to trained
      stimuli in adult macaques). Second, the anatomical locus of the effects of
      childhood experience differs across species. In humans, the most prominent
      functional developments have been reported in the FG20,74–78 and OTS52,77,
      but in macaques they are largely around the superior temporal sulcus and
      adjacent gyri32,33. Notably, the FG is a hominoid-specific structure79,
      which underscores why development and training effects may vary across
      species. Third, the features of visual stimuli and how they interact with
      cognitive strategies that sculpt the brain during childhood may differ
      across species. That is, developmental predictions about the perceived
      animacy or size of a visual stimuli is readily queried only in humans.<br />
      The unique opportunity presented by Pokémon as a stimulus is the manner in
      which they vary from other visual stimuli in their physical (retinal image
      size, rectilinearity) and perceived (animacy, size) properties.
      Furthermore, the topography of the responses in experienced cortices was
      consistent across individuals, allowing us to ask which potential
      dimension of Pokémon visual features, either perceived or physical, may
      determine the anatomical localization of Pokémon responses in the VTC. The
      lateral location of this emergent representation, and its foveally biased
      pRFs, suggests that the act of foveating on images that subtend a small
      retinal image during childhood biases input towards regions in the lateral
      VTC that have pRFs that overlap the fovea. We posit that individuals
      experienced with Pokémon had enough patterned visual experience for this
      biased input to result in category selectivity. Several aspects of our
      data indicate that retinal eccentricity is the dominant factor in
      determining the functional topography of the VTC. <br />Although this by
      no means invalidates observations of other large-scale patterns describing
      the functional topography of high-level vision, our data suggest that
      retinal eccentricity is a key developmental factor in determining the
      consistent functional topography of the VTC across individuals, for
      several reasons. First, analyses of the physical and perceived properties
      of Pokémon characters suggest that the attribute of Pokémon stimuli that
      best predicts the location of peak selectivity for responses to Pokémon in
      the VTC was the experienced retinal eccentricity of Pokémon during
      childhood. Second, pRFs of VTC voxels selective for Pokémon in experienced
      participants showed a foveal bias. Future research examining how these
      representations emerge during childhood as participants learn these
      stimuli will be important for verifying that the foveal bias in the OTS
      precedes the emerging selectivity to Pokémon. Indeed, although Pokémon
      have almost linear statistics at the image level, individuals are capable
      of integrating holistically over a large number of pixels to perceive a
      curve. The extent to which this may be modulated by experience and
      potentially impact pRFs during learning is an interesting focus for future
      research. Third, although the representation of animacy also exhibits a
      lateral− medial organization in the human VTC, Pokémon are perceived as
      less animate than faces, but their representation appeared lateral to
      face-selective regions. In other words, if the animacy axis is continuous
      across the VTC, with animate representations in the OTS and inanimate on
      the CoS, one would expect Pokémon-selective voxels to be located medial to
      the face-selective cortex. <br />Although we observe that such a medial
      region is capable of responding to animate stimuli (Supplementary Fig. 8),
      it does not become selective for Pokémon across development. Instead,
      Pokémon-selective voxels were found in the OTS, lateral to the
      face-selective cortex. Although high-level visual cortex is capable of
      distinguishing animate from inanimate stimuli23, it might not be a
      continuous graded representation across the cortical sheet per se. Thus,
      the framework that human high-level visual cortex has a representation of
      retinal eccentricity, probably inherited from retinotopic input in earlier
      visual field maps, offers a parsimonious explanation of the development of
      Pokémon representations in the VTC. <br />Future research can examine how
      becoming a Pokémon expert in childhood, which probably entails learning
      optimal fixation patterns on Pokémon stimuli, may further sculpt pRFs
      throughout development as observed in face- and word-selective cortex31.
      In conclusion, these findings shed light on the plasticity of the human
      brain and how experience at a young age can alter cortical
      representations.<br />An intriguing implication of our study is that a
      common extensive visual experience in childhood leads to a common
      representation with a consistent functional topography in the brains of
      adults. This suggests that how we look at an item and the quality with
      which we see it during childhood affects the way that visual
      representations are shaped in the brain. Our data raise the possibility
      that if people do not share common visual experiences of a stimulus during
      childhood, either from disease, as is the case in cataracts, or cultural
      differences in viewing patterns, then an atypical or unique representation
      of that stimulus may result in adulthood, which has important implications
      for learning disabilities83,84 and social disabilities85. Overall, our
      study underscores the utility of developmental research, showing that
      visual experience beginning in childhood results in functional brain
      changes that are qualitatively different from plasticity in adulthood.
      Future research to examine the amount of visual experience necessary to
      induce distinct cortical specialization and determine the extent of the
      critical window during which such childhood plasticity is possible will
      further deepen our understanding of the development of the human visual
      system and its behavioural ramifications.
