          The Wavicle, or wave-particle duality, suggests that all objects
          exhibit both wave and partical properties. Between observations as it
          evolves on its own, it behaves like a wave; distributed across space,
          exploring different intermixing paths to all possible destinations.
          However, when its location or speed is measured, it appears definite
          and concrete, like a particle. Its wave nature gives this measurement
          a curious property: the more certain we are about either speed or
          position, the more uncertain we become about the other.
          Uncertainty/doube. Valuing both process and outcome. -

          I was also raised to believe that we were eventually going to live on
          Venus. In my early twenties, years after I left the Family, I was
          describing my childhood to someone and she said, “That doesn’t sound
          like a commune—it sounds like a cult.” I still balk at this word and
          all the preconceived notions that come with it. What’s the difference
          between a commune and a cult? Here’s one: a cult never calls itself a
          cult. It’s a term created by people not in cults to label and classify
          groups they view to be extreme or dangerous. So it feels judgmental,
          presumptuous, and narrow in scope. It makes me feel protective of my
          upbringing. You don’t know how it was. -

          Since childhood, Needy has been best friends with Jennifer Check, a
          popular and beautiful high school color guard flag spinner, despite
          the two having little in common. Jennifer often mistreats and
          dominates Needy, who is too in awe of her to stand up for herself. One
          night, Jennifer takes Needy to a local dive bar to attend a concert by
          indie rock band Low Shoulder. A fire engulfs the bar, killing several
          people. Jennifer, in shock from the fire, leaves with the band even
          though Needy tells her not to. Later that evening, she appears in
          Needy's kitchen, covered in blood, and attempts to eat a rotisserie
          chicken. She immediately vomits a trail of black fluid and almost
          bites Needy's neck, but retreats and leaves. -

          Whenever you read a new piece of writing (at least a page long, social
          media posts don't count), choose a passage that you enjoy from it
        </li>
        <li>Record the passage here so you can track your reading later!</li>
